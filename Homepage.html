                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Gauteng's industries lose significant time and money due to traffic delays, poor route planning, and unpredictable congestion. Delivery trucks often get stuck in traffic, which delays goods reaching factories, warehouses, or customers. This increases fuel costs, late deliveries, and customer dissatisfaction.</p>
